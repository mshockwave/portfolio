<img src="/images/formal2-tiny.jpg" alt="profile pic" style="width: 35%"/>

My name is **Min-Yih "Min" Hsu**. I work as a compiler engineer at [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com/) and am currently based in the beautiful Southern California, United States.

I have been actively contributing to [LLVM](https://llvm.org) for over 5 years; I served on the program commitee for multiple LLVM Developer's Meetings.
I wrote a LLVM book in 2021 titled [_LLVM Techniques, Tips, and Best Practices Clang and Middle-End Libraries_](https://a.co/d/0AXkEdI).
I'm also the code owner and primary maintainer of LLVM's M68k compiler backend.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of California, Irvine (UCI) in 2023; my doctoral advisor is [Prof. Dr. Michael Franz](https://www.michaelfranz.com/).
